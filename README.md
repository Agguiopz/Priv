## Classlink Login
<br/>
**Classlink login** is an html file that allows you to **flood your history with "Classlink Login"** to hide uneducational websites from your browser history. This will cause your computer to lag during flooding based on how big your number is put.

### How do I use it?
<br/>
1. <a href='https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Classlink%20Login.html'>Download the HTML file</a>
2. Open it
3. Put in the username and password which are both ``history``
4. Put an integer greater than one
5. You are all set, you can keep this running.

### How can I change the credentials and the name/history
Just open up the html file source code then find what you want to rename and then download the html file
