## Classlink Login

𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 is an html file that allows you to 𝗳𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻 to hide uneducational websites from your browser history. This will cause your computer to lag during flooding based on how big your number is put.

## ExtHang3r
𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗴𝟯𝗿 is an exploit that allows ChromeOS users to 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 after the LTMEAT patch. It remains unpatched in all new ChromeOS versions as of November 2024.

Created by [Blobby](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi)

### How do I use it?
Download the <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Ext-Hang3r.html">HTML file</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Ext-Hang3r">copy the data: link and paste it into a new tab</a>

### Note
When you start hanging it will take longer than one minute and it will lag a ton since it is refreshing iframes, so I recommend closing all your other tabs before hanging. If you are using securly please use ``securly (old)`` to disable Securly for Chromebooks.
